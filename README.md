## Objective: Financial Agentic System

### Project Requirements
For the final project, you and your teammates will build an agentic AI that researches markets. Your agentic AI should demonstrate the following workflow patterns and autonomous agent functions.

#### Agent Functions 
Build an autonomous Investment Research Agent that:

- Plans its research steps for a given stock symbol.
- Uses tools dynamically (APIs, datasets, retrieval).
- Self-reflects to assess the quality of its output.
- Learns across runs (e.g., keeps brief memories or notes to improve future analyses).

#### Workflow Patterns
Implement the following three workflow patterns: 

- Prompt Chaining: Ingest News → Preprocess → Classify → Extract → Summarize
- Routing: Direct content to the right specialist (e.g., earnings, news, or market analyzers).
- Evaluator–Optimizer: Generate analysis → evaluate quality → refine using feedback.
