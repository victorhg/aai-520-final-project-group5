    "This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the autonomous Investment Research Agent system. The system demonstrates advanced agentic capabilities including autonomous planning, dynamic tool usage, self-reflection, and cross-session learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Investment Research Agent is an autonomous AI system that:\n",
    "- **Plans research steps** autonomously for any stock symbol\n",
    "- **Uses tools dynamically** (APIs, datasets, retrieval systems)\n",
    "- **Self-reflects** to assess output quality across multiple dimensions\n",
    "- **Learns across runs** through persistent memory and experience synthesis\n",
